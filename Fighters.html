All former WEC fighters have had their WEC record listed in place of their UFC record, starting with WEC 25 (the first WEC event under Zuffa). These records have been, and will be, continued as former WEC fighters move on in the UFC.</p>

                <p>Strikeforce was purchased by Zuffa in 2011 and officially merged under the UFC brand on January 12, 2013.
